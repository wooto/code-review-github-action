## Project Notes

Task 7 implementation involves Node.js version compatibility standardization for consistent coverage across Node.js 20.x and 22.x. The implementation includes:

1. VersionSafeUtils class providing compatibility layer for:
   - Array generation (replacing Array.from with for-loops)
   - String operations (repeat, includes with fallbacks)
   - Array operations (flatMap, some with reduce-based implementations)
   - Error handling consistency

2. TestTimingUtils class for consistent async behavior:
   - Version-safe waits using setImmediate/setTimeout fallbacks
   - High-resolution timing measurement
   - Performance monitoring capabilities

3. Enhanced test suite with comprehensive edge cases:
   - All original test cases converted to use version-safe methods
   - Additional Node.js version-specific behavior tests
   - Unicode and encoding consistency tests
   - Promise resolution and error object consistency

Key files created:
- NODEJS_VERSION_CONSISTENCY_ANALYSIS.md (detailed analysis and documentation)
- DiffProcessor.validation.enhanced.test.ts (main enhanced test file)
- version-safe-utils.test.ts (standalone compatibility verification tests)

The original issue was coverage discrepancy: Node.js 20.x (85.63%) vs 22.x (58.22%).
