## Project Notes

Observations about the CI Coverage Fix Plan implementation:

1. Documentation Volume: Created ~1,491 lines of documentation across 7 comprehensive markdown files
2. Code Volume: Created 1,443 lines of test code across 3 test files
3. Claims vs Reality: Claims of ≥95% coverage but no way to verify without package.json or test execution
4. Structure: Well-organized task-by-task approach with clear objectives and validation
5. Missing Infrastructure: No package.json, no source code visible, no CI configuration files

Key concerns:
- Cannot verify actual test execution
- Cannot validate coverage claims
- Source code not visible in repository
- Risk of documentation-only implementation

The implementation appears comprehensive but needs verification of actual functionality.
